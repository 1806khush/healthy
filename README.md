ðŸ©º Smart Doctor Appointment Management System
This project is a web-based Doctor Appointment and Profile Management System, developed using Python (Django) for the backend and HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the frontend. The system aims to simplify the interaction between patients and healthcare professionals by allowing users to view doctor profiles, check availability, and book appointments online. It also enables doctors to manage their professional profiles and provide additional services like telemedicine, home visits, and emergency care.

From the user's side, the platform provides the ability to browse a list of verified doctors along with their specializations, qualifications, years of experience, languages spoken, and consultation fees. Each doctor has a dedicated profile page that includes a brief biography, services offered, and availability in morning, afternoon, or evening slots. Users can select any doctor based on their preferences and book an appointment directly from the interface. Features like multilingual support and profile photos enhance the user experience and help in making informed choices.

For doctors, the system includes a detailed registration and profile management interface. Doctors can submit their credentials such as name, specialization, highest qualification, position (e.g., Consultant or Head of Department), and years of experience. They can also set their availability hours and indicate whether they offer services like emergency care, international consultations, or insurance acceptance. Doctors can upload a profile image and a short biography to build trust with potential patients.

The project uses session-based authentication to differentiate between users and doctors. Depending on the user type, the system dynamically renders different templates (e.g., userdetails.html for users and docdetails.html for doctors). Admin functionality can be added to approve new doctor registrations, monitor activity, and manage appointments, although it is optional in the current version.

The backend is powered by SQLite3, Djangoâ€™s default database, making it lightweight and easy to run locally. The project is structured into a modular Django app with clearly defined models for User and Doctor, and includes robust error handling for missing or invalid form data.

This system is ideal as a final-year college project as it incorporates key real-world features like dynamic routing, user role-based rendering, form validation, image handling, and CRUD operations using Django's ORM. It provides a solid demonstration of full-stack development principles, healthcare domain knowledge, and web application architecture.
